Resampling strategies are usually used to assess the performance of a learning algorithm:
The entire data set is (repeatedly) split into training sets $D^{*b}$ and test sets $D \setminus D^{*b}$, $b = 1,\ldots,B$.
The learner is trained on each training set, predictions are made on the corresponding test set (sometimes on the training set as well) and the performance measure $S(D^{*b}, D \setminus D^{*b})$ is calculated.
Then the $B$ individual performance values are aggregated, most often by calculating the mean.
There exist various different resampling strategies, for example cross-validation and bootstrap, to mention just two popular approaches.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "400pt", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Resampling Figure", eval = knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to") == "latex"}

```

```

If you want to read up on further details, the paper [Resampling Strategies for Model Assessment and Selection](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-0-387-47509-7_8) by Simon is probably not a bad choice.
Bernd has also published a paper [Resampling methods for meta-model validation with recommendations for evolutionary computation](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/EVCO_a_00069) which contains detailed descriptions and lots of statistical background information on resampling methods.

### Defining the resampling strategy

In `mlr` the resampling strategy can be defined via function `makeResampleDesc()`.
It requires a string that specifies the resampling method and, depending on the selected strategy, further information like the number of iterations.
The supported resampling strategies are:

* Cross-validation (``"CV"``),
* Leave-one-out cross-validation (``"LOO"``),
* Repeated cross-validation (``"RepCV"``),
* Out-of-bag bootstrap and other variants like *b632* (``"Bootstrap"``),
* Subsampling, also called Monte-Carlo cross-validation (``"Subsample"``),
* Holdout (training/test) (``"Holdout"``).

For example if you want to use 3-fold cross-validation type:

```{r}
### 3-fold cross-validation
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3)
rdesc
```

For holdout estimation use:

```{r}
### Holdout estimation
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("Holdout")
rdesc
```

In order to save you some typing `mlr` contains some pre-defined resample descriptions for very common strategies like holdout (`hout` (`makeResampleDesc()`)) as well as cross-validation with different numbers of folds (e.g., `cv5` (`makeResampleDesc()`) or `cv10` (`makeResampleDesc()`)).

```{r}
hout

cv3
```

### Performing the resampling

Function `resample()` evaluates a Learner (`makeLearner()`) on a given machine learning `Task()` using the selected resampling strategy (`makeResampleDesc()`).

As a first example, the performance of linear regression (`stats::lm()`) on the `BostonHousing` (`mlbench::BostonHousing()`) data set is calculated using *3-fold cross-validation*.

Generally, for *$K$-fold cross-validation* the data set $D$ is partitioned into $K$ subsets of (approximately) equal size.
In the $b$-th of the $K$ iterations, the $b$-th subset is used for testing, while the union of the remaining parts forms the training set.

As usual, you can either pass a Learner (`makeLearner()`) object to `resample()` or, as done here, provide the class name `"regr.lm"` of the learner.
Since no performance measure is specified the default for regression learners (mean squared error, [mse](measures.html){target="_blank"}) is calculated.

```{r}
### Specify the resampling strategy (3-fold cross-validation)
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3)

### Calculate the performance
r = resample("regr.lm", bh.task, rdesc)

r
```

The result `r` is an object of class `resample()` result.
It contains performance results for the learner and some additional information like the runtime, predicted values, and optionally the models fitted in single resampling iterations.

```{r}
### Peak into r
names(r)

r$aggr

r$measures.test
```

`r$measures.test` gives the performance on each of the 3 test data sets.
`r$aggr` shows the aggregated performance value.
Its name `"mse.test.mean"` indicates the performance measure, [mse](measures.html){target="_blank"}, and the method, `test.mean` (`aggregations()`), used to aggregate the 3 individual performances. 
`test.mean` (`aggregations()`) is the default aggregation scheme for most performance measures and, as the name implies, takes the mean over the performances on the test data sets.

Resampling in `mlr` works the same way for all types of learning problems and learners.
Below is a classification example where a classification tree (rpart) (`rpart::rpart()`) is evaluated on the `Sonar` (`mlbench::sonar()`) data set by subsampling with 5 iterations.

In each subsampling iteration the data set $D$ is randomly partitioned into a training and a test set according to a given percentage, e.g., 2/3 training and 1/3 test set. 
If there is just one iteration, the strategy is commonly called *holdout* or *test sample estimation*.

You can calculate several measures at once by passing a `list` of Measures (`makeMeasure()`)s to `resample()`.
Below, the error rate ([mmce](measures.html){target="_blank"}), false positive and false negative rates ([fpr](measures.html){target="_blank"}, [fnr](measures.html){target="_blank"}), and the time it takes to train the learner ([timetrain](measures.html){target="_blank"}) are estimated by *subsampling* with 5 iterations.

```{r}
### Subsampling with 5 iterations and default split ratio 2/3
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("Subsample", iters = 5)

### Subsampling with 5 iterations and 4/5 training data
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("Subsample", iters = 5, split = 4/5)

### Classification tree with information splitting criterion
lrn = makeLearner("classif.rpart", parms = list(split = "information"))

### Calculate the performance measures
r = resample(lrn, sonar.task, rdesc, measures = list(mmce, fpr, fnr, timetrain))

r
```

If you want to add further measures afterwards, use `addRRMeasure()`.

```{r}
### Add balanced error rate (ber) and time used to predict
addRRMeasure(r, list(ber, timepredict))
```

By default, `resample()` prints progress messages and intermediate results. You can turn this off by setting `show.info = FALSE`, as done in the code chunk below. 
(If you are interested in suppressing these messages permanently have a look at the tutorial page about [configuring mlr](configureMlr.html){target="_blank"}.)

In the above example, the Learner (`makeLearner()`) was explicitly constructed. 
For convenience you can also specify the learner as a string and pass any learner parameters via the `...` argument of `resample()`.

```{r}
r = resample("classif.rpart", parms = list(split = "information"), sonar.task, rdesc,
  measures = list(mmce, fpr, fnr, timetrain), show.info = FALSE)

r
```

### Accessing resample results

Apart from the learner performance you can extract further information from the resample results, for example predicted values or the models fitted in individual resample iterations.

#### Predictions

Per default, the `resample()` result contains the predictions made during the resampling.
If you do not want to keep them, e.g., in order to conserve memory, set `keep.pred = FALSE` when calling `resample()`.

The predictions are stored in slot `$pred` of the resampling result, which can also be accessed by function `getRRPredictions()`.

```{r}
r$pred

pred = getRRPredictions(r)
pred
```

`pred` is an object of class `resample()` Prediction.
Just as a `Prediction()` object (see the tutorial page on making [predictions](predict.html){target="_blank"} it has an element `$data` which is a `data.frame` that contains the predictions and in the case of a supervised learning problem the true values of the target variable(s).
You can use `as.data.frame` (`Prediction()` to directly access the `$data` slot. 
Moreover, all getter functions for `Prediction()` objects like `getPredictionResponse()` or `getPredictionProbabilities()` are applicable.

```{r}
head(as.data.frame(pred))

head(getPredictionTruth(pred))

head(getPredictionResponse(pred))
```

The columns `iter` and `set` in the `data.frame` indicate the resampling iteration and the data set (`train` or `test`) for which the prediction was made.

By default, predictions are made for the test sets only.
If predictions for the training set are required, set `predict = "train"` (for predictions on the train set only) or `predict = "both"` (for predictions on both train and test sets) in `makeResampleDesc()`. 
In any case, this is necessary for some bootstrap methods (*b632* and *b632+*) and some examples are shown later on.

Below, we use simple Holdout, i.e., split the data once into a training and test set, as resampling strategy and make predictions on both sets.

```{r}
### Make predictions on both training and test sets
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("Holdout", predict = "both")

r = resample("classif.lda", iris.task, rdesc, show.info = FALSE)
r

r$measures.train
```

(Please note that nonetheless the misclassification rate `r$aggr` is estimated on the test data only.
How to calculate performance measures on the training sets is shown below.)

A second function to extract predictions from resample results is `getRRPredictionList()` which returns a `list` of predictions split by data set (train/test) and resampling iteration.

```{r}
predList = getRRPredictionList(r)
predList
```

#### Learner models

In each resampling iteration a Learner (`makeLearner()`) is fitted on the respective training set.
By default, the resulting `WrappedModel` (`makeWrappedModel()`)s are not included in the `resample()` result and slot `$models` is empty.
In order to keep them, set `models = TRUE` when calling `resample()`, as in the following survival analysis example.

```{r}
### 3-fold cross-validation
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3)

r = resample("surv.coxph", lung.task, rdesc, show.info = FALSE, models = TRUE)
r$models
```

#### The extract option

Keeping complete fitted models can be memory-intensive if these objects are large or
the number of resampling iterations is high.
Alternatively, you can use the `extract` argument of `resample()` to retain only the information you need.
To this end you need to pass a function to `extract` which is applied to each `WrappedModel` (`makeWrappedModel()`) object fitted in each resampling iteration.

Below, we cluster the `datasets::mtcars()` data using the $k$-means algorithm with $k = 3$ and keep only the cluster centers.

```{r}
### 3-fold cross-validation
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3)

### Extract the compute cluster centers
r = resample("cluster.kmeans", mtcars.task, rdesc, show.info = FALSE,
  centers = 3, extract = function(x) getLearnerModel(x)$centers)
r$extract
```

As a second example, we extract the variable importances from fitted regression trees using function `getFeatureImportance()`.
(For more detailed information on this topic see the [feature selection](feature_selection.html){target="_blank"} page.)

```{r}
### Extract the variable importance in a regression tree
r = resample("regr.rpart", bh.task, rdesc, show.info = FALSE, extract = getFeatureImportance)
r$extract
```

### Stratification and blocking

* *Stratification* with respect to a categorical variable makes sure that all its values are present in each training and test set in approximately the same proportion as in the original data set.
Stratification is possible with regard to categorical target variables (and thus for supervised classification and survival analysis) or categorical explanatory variables.

* *Blocking* refers to the situation that subsets of observations belong together and must not be separated during resampling. 
Hence, for one train/test set pair the entire block is either in the training set or in the test set.

#### Stratification with respect to the target variable(s)

For classification, it is usually desirable to have the same proportion of the classes in
all of the partitions of the original data set.
This is particularly useful in the case of imbalanced classes and small data sets. 
Otherwise,
it may happen that observations of less frequent classes are missing in some of the training
sets which can decrease the performance of the learner, or lead to model crashes.
In order to conduct stratified resampling, set ``stratify = TRUE`` in `makeResampleDesc()`.

```{r}
### 3-fold cross-validation
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3, stratify = TRUE)

r = resample("classif.lda", iris.task, rdesc, show.info = FALSE)
r
```

Stratification is also available for survival tasks.
Here the stratification balances the censoring rate.

#### Stratification with respect to explanatory variables

Sometimes it is required to also stratify on the input data, e.g., to ensure that all subgroups are represented in all training and test sets.
To stratify on the input columns, specify `factor` columns of your task data via ``stratify.cols``.

```{r}
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3, stratify.cols = "chas")

r = resample("regr.rpart", bh.task, rdesc, show.info = FALSE)
r
```

#### Blocking

If some observations "belong together" and must not be separated when splitting the data into training and test sets for resampling, you can supply this information via a `blocking` `factor` when creating the [task](task.html){target="_blank"}.

```{r}
### 5 blocks containing 30 observations each
task = makeClassifTask(data = iris, target = "Species", blocking = factor(rep(1:5, each = 30)))
task
```

### Resample descriptions and resample instances

As already mentioned, you can specify a resampling strategy using function `makeResampleDesc()`.

```{r}
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3)
rdesc

str(rdesc)

str(makeResampleDesc("Subsample", stratify.cols = "chas"))
```

The result `rdesc` inherits from class `ResampleDesc` (`makeResampleDesc()`) (short for resample description) and, in principle, contains all necessary information about the resampling strategy including the number of iterations, the proportion of training and test sets, stratification variables, etc.

Given either the size of the data set at hand or the `Task()`, function `makeResampleInstance()` draws the training and test sets according to the `ResampleDesc` (`makeResampleDesc()`).

```{r}
### Create a resample instance based an a task
rin = makeResampleInstance(rdesc, iris.task)
rin

str(rin)

### Create a resample instance given the size of the data set
rin = makeResampleInstance(rdesc, size = nrow(iris))
str(rin)

### Access the indices of the training observations in iteration 3
rin$train.inds[[3]]
```

The result `rin` inherits from class `ResampleInstance` (`makeResampleInstance()`) and contains `list`s of index vectors for the train and test sets.

If a `ResampleDesc` (`makeResampleDesc()`) is passed to `resample()`, it is instantiated internally.
Naturally, it is also possible to pass a `ResampleInstance` (`makeResampleInstance()`) directly.

While the separation between resample descriptions, resample instances, and the `resample()` function itself seems overly complicated, it has several advantages:

* Resample instances readily allow for paired experiments, that is comparing the performance of several learners on exactly the same training and test sets.
This is particularly useful if you want to add another method to a comparison experiment you already did. 
Moreover, you can store the resample instance along with your data in order to be able to reproduce your results later on.

```{r}
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3)
rin = makeResampleInstance(rdesc, task = iris.task)

### Calculate the performance of two learners based on the same resample instance
r.lda = resample("classif.lda", iris.task, rin, show.info = FALSE)
r.rpart = resample("classif.rpart", iris.task, rin, show.info = FALSE)
r.lda$aggr

r.rpart$aggr
```

* In order to add further resampling methods you can simply derive from the `ResampleDesc` (`makeResampleDesc()`) and `ResampleInstance` (`makeResampleInstance()`) classes, but you do neither have to touch `resample()` nor any further methods that use the resampling strategy.

Usually, when calling `makeResampleInstance()` the train and test index sets are drawn randomly.
Mainly for *holdout* (*test sample*) *estimation* you might want full control about the training and tests set and specify them manually.
This can be done using function `makeFixedHoldoutInstance()`.

```{r}
rin = makeFixedHoldoutInstance(train.inds = 1:100, test.inds = 101:150, size = 150)
rin
```

### Aggregating performance values

In each resampling iteration $b = 1,\ldots,B$ we get performance values $S(D^{*b}, D \setminus D^{*b})$ (for each measure we wish to calculate), which are then aggregated to an overall performance.

For the great majority of common resampling strategies (like holdout, cross-validation, subsampling) performance values are calculated on the test data sets only and for most measures aggregated by taking the mean (`test.mean`(`aggregations()`)).

Each performance `Measure` (`makeMeasure()`) in `mlr` has a corresponding default aggregation method which is stored in slot `$aggr`.
The default aggregation for most measures is `test.mean`(`aggregations()`).
One exception is the root mean square error ([rmse](measures.html){target="_blank"}).

```{r}
### Mean misclassification error
mmce$aggr

mmce$aggr$fun

### Root mean square error
rmse$aggr

rmse$aggr$fun
```

You can change the aggregation method of a `Measure` (`makeMeasure()`) via function `setAggregation()`.
All available aggregation schemes are listed on the `aggregations()` documentation page.

#### Example: One measure with different aggregations

The aggregation schemes `test.median` (`aggregations()`), `test.min` (`aggregations()`), and `text.max` (`aggregations()`) compute the median, minimum, and maximum of the performance values on the test sets.

```{r}
mseTestMedian = setAggregation(mse, test.median)
mseTestMin = setAggregation(mse, test.min)
mseTestMax = setAggregation(mse, test.max)

mseTestMedian

rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3)
r = resample("regr.lm", bh.task, rdesc, measures = list(mse, mseTestMedian, mseTestMin, mseTestMax))

r

r$aggr
```

#### Example: Calculating the training error

Below we calculate the mean misclassification error ([mmce](measures.html){target="_blank"}) on the training
and the test data sets. 
Note that we have to set `predict = "both"` when calling `makeResampleDesc()` in order to get predictions on both training and test sets.

```{r}
mmceTrainMean = setAggregation(mmce, train.mean)
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("CV", iters = 3, predict = "both")
r = resample("classif.rpart", iris.task, rdesc, measures = list(mmce, mmceTrainMean))

r$measures.train

r$aggr
```

#### Example: Bootstrap

In *out-of-bag bootstrap estimation* $B$ new data sets $D^{*1}, \ldots, D^{*B}$ are drawn
from the data set $D$ with replacement, each of the same size as $D$.
In the $b$-th iteration, $D^{*b}$ forms the training set, while the remaining elements from
$D$, i.e., $D \setminus D^{*b}$, form the test set.

<!--(
                     |resampling_desc_figure|

                     |resampling_nested_resampling_figure|
)-->

The *b632* and *b632+* variants calculate a convex combination of the training performance and the out-of-bag bootstrap performance and thus require predictions on the training sets and an appropriate aggregation strategy.

```{r}
### Use bootstrap as resampling strategy and predict on both train and test sets
rdesc = makeResampleDesc("Bootstrap", predict = "both", iters = 10)

### Set aggregation schemes for b632 and b632+ bootstrap
mmceB632 = setAggregation(mmce, b632)
mmceB632plus = setAggregation(mmce, b632plus)

mmceB632

r = resample("classif.rpart", iris.task, rdesc, measures = list(mmce, mmceB632, mmceB632plus),
  show.info = FALSE)
head(r$measures.train)

### Compare misclassification rates for out-of-bag, b632, and b632+ bootstrap
r$aggr
```

### Convenience functions

The functionality described on this page allows for much control and flexibility.
However, when quickly trying out some learners, it can get tedious to type all the code for defining the resampling strategy, setting the aggregation scheme and so on.
As mentioned above, `mlr` includes some pre-defined resample description objects for frequently used strategies like, e.g., 5-fold cross-validation (`cv5` (`makeResampleDesc()`)).
Moreover, `mlr` provides special functions for the most common resampling methods, for example `holdout` (`resample()`), `crossval` (`resample()`), or `bootstrapB632` (`resample()`).

```{r}
crossval("classif.lda", iris.task, iters = 3, measures = list(mmce, ber))

bootstrapB632plus("regr.lm", bh.task, iters = 3, measures = list(mse, mae))
```
